## :page_facing_up: About
The below are the criteria set out by the course that I will need to meet:
### Technical Requirements
-   


### Necessary Deliverables (Minimum Viable Product)
-   The Game will need to be able to finish with one winner being determined.
-   All landmark abilities to be working successfully.
-   Blue and Red cards to be created. 
-   Game can be played locally on one computer.


### Extras
-   Green and Purple cards to be created.
-   Game can be hosted and be played on multiple computers over the internet.

 
## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
### General Plan

Some basic rules on how to play the game. More for me to process the mechanics and breaking the game down a bit for planning.

### Win Conditions
The aim of the game is to be the first to construct all four landmarks. They can be constructed in any order.
    *Logic: Players will be objects and have landmark keys set to false. As they buy the landmarks, they will be switched to true. Once all landmark keys are true, then they will be the winner.*

### Players
The game is a 2-4 player game. Generally it is more enjoyable with more players. 
    *Logic: Players will be able to input their names in the welcome screen. Below is what I envision the player will look like.

```
let player1 = {
    name: "",
    coins: 3,
    establishments: ["1B", "2-3G"],
    lmTrainStation: false,
    lmShoppingMall: false,
    lmAmusementPark: false,
    lmRadioTower: false,
}
```

### Landmarks Cards

Players will be able to choose at the beginning of their turn to roll 1 or 2 dice.
