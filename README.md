# Machi Koro
The final project of my Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Aseembly. As the final project, I would like to recreate a board game called Machi Koro that my board game crew loves to play. This is for education purposes only and because of my passion for spending great times with friends. Images of the cards have been taken online and modified to suit my version. <br/>

Use the Problem Solving Process framework to break down the project into manageable components. From Technical Requirements & Necessary Deliverables
